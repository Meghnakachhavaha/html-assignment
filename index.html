	<p><sup>hello! my name is Meghna and I am from a nuclear family which consists of my parents and a younger sibling. India is my nation where the cultural heritage is being praised throughout the world. I am here to pursue my dream of becoming an web-designer.</sup></p>
	<p><sup>Moving forward to my personality; i would say I am an overthinker, who would always be concerned about what other says to me and about me overall I am a helper..... if someone is in need and asks for help I would not think twice to do so. In addition to that my interest is more is creating something like designer i.e., something like card making or canvas or the front end which looks too attractive to me. And according to me it shows my personality. <br> <EM>-MEGHNA</EM></sup></p>
